Random Photographic Exposure Settings Generator
===============================================

Generates random photographic exposure settings.  Supply approximate shooting
conditions (or use the default of Sunny 16 = +20 EV).  Generated settings will
mostly be within 1 or 2 stops of the supplied conditions, but if you're feeling
lucky, you can ramp up the difficulty.

For usage, see `./expgen.py --help`
